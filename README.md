## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze insurance data and predict risk factors. The tasks have been divided into two main sections: Git and GitHub setup for version control, CI/CD pipelines, and data analysis using Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) and Data Version Control (DVC).

## Task 1: Git and GitHub

### Git Version Control
The first step is to establish version control for the project using Git and GitHub. This includes:
- Creating a GitHub repository.
- Committing changes frequently to document the progress.
- Creating a new branch `task-1` for day 1 analysis.
- Writing descriptive commit messages to explain each change.

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions
We set up GitHub Actions to automate the process of testing and deploying the code. The actions will run tests whenever changes are made and ensure that the project is always in a deployable state.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is the key to understanding the data and discovering insights. In this task, we will perform several analyses:
- **Data Summarization:**
  - Descriptive statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, etc.) for numerical features such as TotalPremium, TotalClaim.
  - Data structure check to ensure variables are correctly formatted.
- **Data Quality Assessment:**
  - Checking for missing values and handling them appropriately.
- **Univariate Analysis:**
  - Plotting histograms for numerical columns.
  - Plotting bar charts for categorical columns.
- **Bivariate or Multivariate Analysis:**
  - Exploring relationships between variables like `TotalPremium` and `TotalClaims` using scatter plots and correlation matrices.
- **Outlier Detection:**
  - Using box plots to detect outliers in numerical data.
- **Trends Over Geography:**
  - Analyzing changes in insurance cover type, premium, auto make, etc., across different geographical regions.

### Data Visualization
- Create at least **3 beautiful plots** to highlight key insights from the analysis.

## Task 2: Data Version Control (DVC)

### Install DVC
To begin versioning our data, we install **DVC (Data Version Control)** with the following command:
```bash
pip install dvc
```

### Set Up Local Remote Storage
1. Create a storage directory to store the versioned data.
```bash
mkdir ./dvc_storage
```
2. Set up the local storage as a DVC remote:
```bash
dvc remote add -d localstorage ./dvc_storage
```

### Add Data
1. Add your dataset (e.g., `data.csv`) to the project directory and track it with DVC:
```bash
dvc add data.csv
```
2. Commit the changes to version control:
```bash
git add data.csv.dvc
git commit -m "Task-2: Added data and started tracking with DVC"
```

### Push Data to Local Remote
Push your versioned data to the local storage:
```bash
dvc push
```

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/InsuranceRiskPrediction.git
cd InsuranceRiskPrediction
```

2. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Make sure you have DVC installed and set up for version control:
```bash
pip install dvc
```

4. To run the analyses, follow the instructions in the project’s individual notebooks or scripts in the repository.

## Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)

### Task 1 KPIs:
- **Dev Environment Setup:** Successfully set up the project environment and GitHub repository.
- **Relevant Skill Demonstrated:** Proficiency in Git, GitHub, and CI/CD with GitHub Actions.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**
  - Clear and accurate summary of the data.
  - Use of statistical methods for data understanding.
  - Visualizing key trends and insights from the data.

### Task 2 KPIs:
- **Data Versioning:** Successful setup and use of DVC for data tracking.
- **Commit Messages:** Well-defined commit messages and version control of data changes.
- **Data Push to Remote:** Successful push of versioned data to the DVC remote storage.
